<p>
  Welcome! I am Yan Wu, a third-year master student of Economics at the School of Business, <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/">Nanjing University</a>, where I also got my Bachelor degree of Economics. During my first undergraduate year, I received liberal education with a focus on social sciences.

  I am interested in the changes digital platforms have brought to individuals and society, particularly with the explosion of structured/unstructured data and application of AI technology. Through the lens of Information Systems, I hope to understand these changes and improve social welfare. To achieve this goal, I use methods including Econometrics, Machine/Deep Learning, Text Mining/NLP.
