Since 2023, I have been intentionally keeping an record of my footprints with my phone[^1]. The above picture is a summary of my footprints towards dfferent provinces throughout 2023. It reminds me of those specific moments during the trip, in the form of location data. Thanks to IT, I have these 'digital evidence' for my life.
